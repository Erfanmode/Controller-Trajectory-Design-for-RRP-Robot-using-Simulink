# Controller & Trajectory Design for RRP Robot with Obstacles Avoidance Capability using Simulink
This work is the Robotics Course Project of Mechanical Engineering Department at Sharif University of Technology.
In this project I have designed a RRP Robot which its end-effector is controlled using PID method.
Additionally, an adaptive potential field with singularity avoidance algorithm and Dijkstra are used to design the path of the
end-effector in a 2D environment filled with obstacles
